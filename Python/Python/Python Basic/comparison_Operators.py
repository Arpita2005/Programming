#Comparison operator is use to compare two or more value which is bigger or not
# it return only in True or False
print(3>2) # it will return True : cause 3 is more than 2
print(3<2) # It will return False : cause 2 is not more than 3
print(3<=2) # It will return False : cause 2 is not more than or same  3
print(3>=2) # It will return True : cause 3 is more than or not same 2 (Just have to match with one condition)
print(3==2) # It will return False : cause 3 is not same as 2
print(3==3) # It will return True : cause 3 is  same as 3
print(3 != 3) # it will return False : cause ! sign will change the value answer True to false and false to True
print(3 != 2)# It will retirn True : cause ! sign will change the value answer True to False and False to True



            #Logical Operator

# OR operator
print("------------OR Operator--------------")
print(2>3 or 3>2) # it will return true : cause 2>3 if False but 3>2 is True

# and operator
print("------------and Operator--------------")

print(3>2 and 2>1) # It will print True cause and operator will verify all conditions have to true

print(3>2 and 2>6) #It will print false cause one condition is false so it will print false


#not operator
print("------------not Operator--------------")

# not operator change the True to false and False to true
print (2>3) # it will print false 
print (not 2>3)#it will print True
