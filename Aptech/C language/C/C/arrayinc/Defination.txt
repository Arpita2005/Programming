                What is the difference between dynamic and static memory allocation?
                When the allocation of memory performs at the compile time,
                then it is known as static memory. When the memory allocation is 
                done at the execution or run time, then it is called dynamic memory allocation. 
                The memory is allocated at the compile time. The memory is allocated at the runtime.
