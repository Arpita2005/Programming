Using pointer in C programming has following advantages:

Pointers provide direct access to memory.
Pointers provide a way to return multiple values from a user defined function without using return keyword.
Pointers reduce the storage space and complexity of programs.
Pointers reduce the execution time of programs.
Pointers provide an alternate way to access individual array elements.
Pointers allow us to perform dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
Pointers allow us to create more complex data structures like linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks etc.
