Macro preprocessor
===============
The C preprocessor is a macro preprocessor (allows you to define macros) that transforms your program before it is compiled. These transformations can be the inclusion of header file, macro expansions etc.

All preprocessing directives begin with a # symbol. For example,

           #define PI 3.14
